Repository to store all the resources for IIITD courses. You can use either the [website](https://aflah02.github.io/SemWiseResourcesIIIT/) or the README.md file to access the resources.

If you want to add resources but confused about how to start, please refer to this [guide](https://github.com/aflah02/SemWiseResourcesIIIT/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)

Note: The process has recently changed (December 2023) and the changes now need to go to `resources.yaml` and not to `README.md` directly
